The New Yorker: Data Journalist

> The New Yorker is seeking an experienced data journalist to join our small but highly motivated Multimedia and Interactive Features team. You will pitch, report, and build data-driven stories for newyorker.com while collaborating with editors, producers, designers, and developers. This is a journalistic position as much as a technical one. In addition to your programming skills, we are looking for interest in key news areas, including politics, immigration, criminal justice, health care, economics, and the environment. While your main responsibility is to take stories from pitch to publication, you will also create supporting data graphics for articles. For example, you might be asked to use data to illustrate extreme-weather events; or the popularity of a song over time, based on Spotify data; or gun purchases, using the state-level data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As part of The New Yorker’s multimedia team, you will create work that pushes the boundaries of visual journalism and supports world-class reporting.

This position will work closely with our Design Lead for Editorial Interactives, alongside another dedicated developer and researcher, and reports to the Multimedia Editor.

Please send a résumé with a link to your portfolio, as well as a memo about why your experience makes you a good fit for this team. Apply here.

Pitch data-driven stories or graphics.
Create data visualizations based on your reporting and research.
Assist other team members with data research for graphics, which includes generating maps.
Develop data interactives to work across newyorker.com and associated app platforms and our browser-support list.
Take initial concept to publication, while incorporating editorial changes.
Adhere to the visual-style guide of The New Yorker.

Willingness to work occasional nights or weekends, based on story deadlines.
Fastidious attention to detail and exceptional organizational skills.
Ability to visualize complex ideas in a clear, accurate, and intelligent manner.
Proficiency at writing detailed and accessible methodology notes.
Good engineering habits, including commenting code and using version control (Git).
Strong editorial values and appreciation for the history, style, and standards of The New Yorker.
Nice to have:

Experience with data mining.
Interest in innovative storytelling formats, A.R., V.R., or 3-D.

**ICIJ Data Reporter**
We are hiring a data analyst to join ICIJ’s data and research team. The position will play an integral part in ICIJ’s data and research desk helping with finding innovative ways of gathering, processing, analyzing and visualizing data to contribute with joint reporting efforts for specific ICIJ investigative projects and connect information across borders. The data reporter will coordinate data work with other team members at different stages of a project, including in the fact-checking phase.

The data reporter is expected to work closely with other team members to identify different ways in which data work could help answer reporting needs. ICIJ is looking for someone who is not afraid of leading, proposing ideas and collaborating with others, while sometimes dealing with complex data that could involve thousands or millions of records in different formats, and not always clean and structured at an initial stage.

To work at ICIJ, you will need to be an effective collaborator, willing to work with colleagues and partners in different time zones, departments and languages (this might mean meetings at odd times of the day.) Not only will you get to work with some of the world’s best journalists on international investigations, but you’ll also be a valued part of the ICIJ team. We want someone who isn’t afraid to share their ideas and willing to step in where needed.

The team at ICIJ is small but highly ambitious, creative, energetic and passionate about our mission: producing investigative journalism with global impact. We value team players who are willing to go beyond the duties on their job description to help the organization grow. ICIJ prides itself on supporting career development and nurturing skills to help each employee achieve their full potential.

Your responsibilities and opportunities may include, but are not limited to:

Collaborate with other team members to find answers through data for specific reporting needs
Work on projects involving data gathering, cleaning, processing, analysis and visualization as well as other data-related tasks
Explore, propose and execute new data related ideas and approaches for different ICIJ projects
Explore new possibilities of data research and analysis based on specific project needs
Document ICIJ’s data processes and help ensure that the work complies with ICIJ’s ethic rules and standards.
Validate and help assessing the quality of the data obtained and used for different projects
Assess and use combinations of different data sources to help with the exploration of topics systematically at a global scale. Help identify story leads and reporting possibilities through public data gathering and analysis
Help with training activities to contribute with the understanding of the data used for specific ICIJ projects
Your skills and experience:
Data reporters with any level of experience are encouraged to apply, including junior, mid-career and senior data specialists.

Essential

The capability to identify best data analysis approaches based on complexity, quality, size and data structure (using spreadsheet programs, business analysis software or code, depending on specific needs)
At least 3 years of experience with demonstrated results
Ability to mine data and produce analysis that can help identify leads or be at the heart of a reporting process
The capability to work as part of a team and produce key analysis to answer journalistic needs
Ability to work with structured and unstructured data and research relevant context and documentation linked to it
Knowledge of public databases that could be used for journalistic research
Writing abilities and excellent communication skills
Good organizational and leadership skills
Good sense of humor, consideration for others, and a passion for journalism
Preferred

Languages (including Spanish, French, German, Portuguese) are a plus
Machine Learning applied to journalism knowledge or practical experience is a plus
Ability to take initiative, receive constructive feedback and learn about new technologies
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists is a global network of more than 220 of the world’s best reporters in 83 countries who collaborate on large-scale investigations on issues that do not stop at national frontiers: cross-border crime, corruption, and the accountability of power. Recent projects include the Implant Files, Paradise Papers, Panama Papers, the Evicted and Abandoned investigation into the impact of World Bank projects, Skin and Bone and more.

Job Description
The New York Times is looking for creative, interdisciplinary thinkers with strong technical backgrounds for our Interactive News team, a special digital projects group embedded within the newsroom.  

This engineering role combines technical and editorial thinking to create new forms for our readers and new ways for our journalists to work.  Our team’s mission is to practice software engineering as a newsroom craft. (Read more on our “About Interactive News” page.)

About You
* You’re interested in applying your engineering skills to solve journalistic problems. We are responsible for creating software and unique interactive experiences that let newsroom staff help readers understand the world in new ways. You value the importance of deadlines; we’ll trust you to deliver.
* You might be a frontend, backend or full stack engineer. Your specific technical background is less important than your willingness and demonstrated ability to learn, collaborate with others, and solve problems of all varieties to get the job done.
* You enjoy collaborative making and iterative learning. We aim to move quickly in aligning our tools and technologies to capitalize on newsroom and reader interests.  This often involves quick pivots, fast iteration and close collaboration with fellow designers, developers, reporters and editors on a project.
* You’re interested in working across a range of newsroom contexts. We help shape new experiences like frontend reader expressions, internal research and reporting admins, one-off scripts or even larger software supporting specific reporting projects.  
* You’ll be contributing to both technical and editorial aspects of this work. We believe the right technology applied at the right points can be transformational for our journalism. 
* You have demonstrated experience as an effective engineer. We will consider full-time professional experience, or significant work as an intern.  A strong command of engineering fundamentals is important, to work fluidly within newsroom discussion and deadlines.

About the Role
* Preference will be given to candidates that can work out of our New York City headquarters or Washington, D.C. bureau. We will also consider applications for remote work, with proven effectiveness as a distributed team member.
* We don’t require expertise on every part of the stack, though you should be prepared to learn the software frameworks we frequently work with. We work primarily in node.js and express, with some ruby, python and golang.  Our apps run in a kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform, most backed by mongo and postgres databases.
* We don’t require deep journalism experience, but you should be a critical thinker when it comes to the news. You’ll be directly involved in shaping thoughtful experiences for New York Times readers.

About the Interactive News team

Our team’s mission is to practice software engineering as a newsroom craft.  Read more on our “About Interactive News” page.

We want to improve our team by better reflecting our broad audience — if you’re a member of a community underrepresented in technology, we encourage you to apply.

The New York Times Company offers a generous parental leave policy that applies to birth parents and adoptive parents. We encourage and pay for conference attendance and offer tuition reimbursement for job-related training.

To Apply

We will be evaluating applications on a rolling basis.  Please submit your application as early as possible.

Instead of a cover letter, our application will use the following materials to evaluate your application:

Your résumé (uploaded as an attachment)
