The New Yorker: Data Journalist

> The New Yorker is seeking an experienced data journalist to join our small but highly motivated Multimedia and Interactive Features team. You will pitch, report, and build data-driven stories for newyorker.com while collaborating with editors, producers, designers, and developers. This is a journalistic position as much as a technical one. In addition to your programming skills, we are looking for interest in key news areas, including politics, immigration, criminal justice, health care, economics, and the environment. While your main responsibility is to take stories from pitch to publication, you will also create supporting data graphics for articles. For example, you might be asked to use data to illustrate extreme-weather events; or the popularity of a song over time, based on Spotify data; or gun purchases, using the state-level data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As part of The New Yorker’s multimedia team, you will create work that pushes the boundaries of visual journalism and supports world-class reporting.

This position will work closely with our Design Lead for Editorial Interactives, alongside another dedicated developer and researcher, and reports to the Multimedia Editor.

Please send a résumé with a link to your portfolio, as well as a memo about why your experience makes you a good fit for this team. Apply here.

Note: If you do not check all of the following boxes, but are enthusiastic about the position please still apply; we are interested in candidates with any combination of skills in these areas.

Primary Responsibilities:
Pitch data-driven stories or graphics.
Create data visualizations based on your reporting and research.
Assist other team members with data research for graphics, which includes generating maps.
Develop data interactives to work across newyorker.com and associated app platforms and our browser-support list.
Take initial concept to publication, while incorporating editorial changes.
Adhere to the visual-style guide of The New Yorker.

Research and learn new languages or technologies as needed.
Requirements:
At least two years of experience reporting and building data visualizations.

Familiarity with a data-visualization library, such as Chart.js or dimple.
Familiarity with standard design software, such as Adobe Illustrator.
Foundational understanding of layout, typography, and UX, particularly with regard to mobile-Web development.
Willingness to work occasional nights or weekends, based on story deadlines.
Fastidious attention to detail and exceptional organizational skills.
Ability to visualize complex ideas in a clear, accurate, and intelligent manner.
Proficiency at writing detailed and accessible methodology notes.
